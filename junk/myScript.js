function myFunction() {
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Paragraph changed.";
}

// Technically with innerHTML you change the whole element, while innerText changes just the plain text'

// document.write is only used for testing because it literally deletes the content

// I've used window.alert() some for putting a notification on their screen (also, you can just say alert)
